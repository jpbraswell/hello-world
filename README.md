# hello-world
Introductory project to learn the workings of this program
Most of this is memory now
I've gone too far to turn back now
I'm not quite what I thought I was but
Then again I maybe more
The blood words promised, I've spoken
Releasing the names from the circle
Maybe I can leave here now and, oh
Transcend the boundaries
For now I'm standing here 
I'm awaiting this grand transition
The future is but past forgotten
On the roads to madness
